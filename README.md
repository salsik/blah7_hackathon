# blah7_hackathon

## Purpose
To work on a glycan image extraction tool.

## Topics
* Data Extraction
* Machine Learning
* Annotation

## Participants
* Kiyoko F. Aoki-Kinoshita
* Alex
* Etwi Barimah Appiah

## Expected outcomes
* Brainstorming

    * Initial assessment on what BLAH7 outcomes should be expected 
        * Glycan image extraction
        * Annotation of glycans to GlyTouCan ID
        * Extraction of Glycan-related text 
        * Annotation of (COVID-19-related) publications with glycan-related terms 

* Development

    * Preliminary data model
    * Initial data extraction from figures in publications
        * Take images in literature and find glycans in these images
        * Extract monosaccarides and convert this information into text format
    * How can we annotate these figures in publications
        * We find the accession number in GlyTouCan IDs
